## Overview

Food waste is a significant problem worldwide. In Europe, platforms like *Too Good To Go* successfully connect restaurants' surplus food with users at low prices, reducing waste. In India, NGOs such as the *Robin Hood Army* manually redistribute excess food, but technology adoption remains limited.

This project aims to develop a web application that enables restaurants, bakeries, and supermarkets to post surplus food items. Verified NGOs or individuals can then view available listings based on their location, claim food pickups, and coordinate logistics.

## Features

- **Food Listing:** Restaurants and supermarkets can list surplus food with quantity, expiry date, and location.  
- **Claim & Pickup:** Verified NGOs and individuals can claim food, with coordinated pickup.  
- **Expiry Tracking:** Alerts and monitoring to prevent expired food distribution.  
- **Google OAuth:** Secure login with Google accounts for both food providers and redistributors.  
- **Badges & Rewards:** Users earn badges for contributions, promoting active participation and trust.  
- **Impact Tracking:** Measure and display the environmental and social impact, such as the amount of food saved and people fed.
